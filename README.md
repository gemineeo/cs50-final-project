## Description
Click&Drink is a web-based ordering application. The goal of the project is to
help bars and restaurants that can't afford to hire a developper or a paid solution
by providing them with a ready-to-implement ordering app.

The app consists of:
- a user-facing mobile web app where consumers can order food and drinks
- an admin interface to manage the items on the menu, and track client orders

## User Journey
